Hey everyone this my bo2 setup everything is already setup I have the jiggy menu Version 4.3 for the multi-player the zombies tranzit remake for solo
zombies has everymap even buried if you haven't had the season pass on pc or ps3 even xbox 
if your having problems with ds4studios just use my gamepad controls for it also i'll leave some instructions here
// step 1. download plutonium they recently added aim assist for control players.
// step 2. extract the cod file and put it on your desktop.
// step 3. open plutonium press game settings and add your bo2 directory folder to plutonium.
once you've done that you will have a button saying from setup to play on both multiplayer and zombies there are 2 files in there
one is called t6 the other t6r then there is t4 and t4 co-op zombies which is waw don't worry about them 
t6r is the bo2 file don't mess with them if you want to have a problem on your hands 
don't touch the t6 folder it has everything that makes blackops2 run and makes it load both keep in mind that multiplayer and zombies are two different launchers
p.s. the ps4 controls are in the cod file as a .XML file
